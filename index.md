### How to Reach the Workshop Venue

Taxis are readily available at the airport exits for a convenient transfer to your destination. Alternatively, you can take the [**Havaist Airport Buses**](https://www.hava.ist/sefer-saatleri.php){:target="_blank"}, which provide reliable and affordable transportation options. For more detailed information, visit the official [**İstanbul Airport website**](https://istanbul-international-airport.com/transportation/bus/){:target="_blank"}.

Please note that the **M11 Metro Line** has not yet been extended to the airport, so metro access is currently unavailable for direct travel from IST.

Alternatively, you can take [**Public Buses**](https://www.sabihagokcen.aero/passengers-and-visitors/transport-and-parking/transportation/public-bus){:target="_blank"} or the [**Havabus Shuttle**](https://www.havabus.com/){:target="_blank"} to reach **Kadıköy** or **Taksim**.

### Using Public Transportation in İstanbul

#### İstanbulkart

The [İstanbulkart](https://www.istanbulkart.istanbul/){:target="_blank"} is a rechargeable card that provides easy access to almost all public transportation services in İstanbul, including metro, buses, trams, ferries, and more. It is widely available at kiosks and vending machines near transportation hubs.

You can also manage your İstanbulkart using the official İstanbulkart App, which makes it easy to check your balance, recharge your card, and plan your trips. Download the app here:

- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.belbim.istanbulkart&pcampaignid=web_share){:target="_blank"}

- [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/id1352307391){:target="_blank"}

#### Route Planning Apps

For planning your routes, you can use the following apps:

**İETT "Otobüsüm Nerede" App:** This official app by İETT (İstanbul Electric Tramway and Tunnel) helps you find the best bus routes and track buses in real-time. Download the app here:

- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iett.otobusumnerede&pcampaignid=web_share){:target="_blank"}

- [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/id1600651996){:target="_blank"}

**Google Maps:** Google Maps is also highly reliable for route planning in İstanbul. It provides detailed directions for public transportation, walking, and driving.

**Tip:** While these apps are helpful, asking a local for directions can sometimes be the best way to navigate İstanbul's public transportation system.
