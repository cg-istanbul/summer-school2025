## About  
This summer school offers introductory lectures on **poset combinatorics** and **symmetric group representations**, aimed at graduate and advanced undergraduate students. 

## Program  
- **Morning (9:30–12:30):** *Poset Combinatorics* – Selçuk Kayacan  
- **Afternoon (13:30–16:30):** *Representations of the Symmetric Group* – Müge Taşkın

## Lecture Topics  

### Poset Combinatorics  
The first lecture series will focus on **poset combinatorics**. The course will begin with the **Möbius function** in number theory and extend this concept to arbitrary posets. Following this, the **order complex of a poset** will be introduced, providing a topological perspective on the subject.  

Methods from **topological combinatorics** will also be explored, with a possible discussion on **Discrete Morse Theory**, a tool used in topological data analysis. If time permits, its applications in this field will be highlighted.  

**Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge in algebra, number theory and topology. Advanced undergraduates with strong mathematical maturity are welcome.

### Representations of symmetric group

## Related Event: Combinatorics and Geometry in İstanbul  

This summer school serves as a preparatory event for the workshop **[Combinatorics and Geometry in İstanbul](https://cg-istanbul.github.io/cgi2025/)**, which will take place on **August 5-6, 2025**.  

The workshop aims to bring together researchers in combinatorics, algebra, and geometry from Turkey and abroad. Graduate students attending the summer school will have the opportunity to build foundational knowledge that may help them engage with the research-level discussions in the workshop.  

## Organizers
